Few years ago I've made a [Wordpress](https://itsiastic.wordpress.com){:target="_blank"} blog to talk about development and algorithms in general. The main idea was to retribute the worldwide developers community with code and ideas the same way they have contributed to me/us all these years since I first became interested in coding dating back from 2000. Yeah! It's been awhile =D.  

Wordpress was, initially, a good (free without freedom) option but now markdown is a way better fit. It's static, it's fast and it's simple. I'll try to migrate all the older posts here to make sure you won't miss a thing, don't worry, I'm really enjoying it so far and I hope you will too =).
