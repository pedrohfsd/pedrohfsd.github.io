title: Optimization with 2-OPT - Part 1

The 2-OPT technique was first proposed by [Croes](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.6.6.791) in 1958. In his paper he defines the technique as an optimized solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem for both symmetric and asymetric instances (the latter requiring more work).  The final answer is usually said to be 2 optimal because i

Accordingly to [Croes](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.6.6.791) own words it can be described as:
> 1. Find a trial Solution \\(s \in S\\), for whch M(s) is as small as we can make it at a first try.
> 1. Apply some transformations, called 'inversions', which transforms this trial solutions into some other elements of S, whose measures are progressive smaller.
> 1. Check C for elements which might be included in the final s at an advantage. If there are any such elements try to find a transformation which decreases the measure of the sequence.
